G15daemon
=========

This is a fork of the currently (as of 11-27-14) neglected g15daemon project repository. It is the lump of subprojects that resided in the SourceForge SVN repo as of the aforementioned date. It's being pulled to allow me to work on getting it back properly functional (seems that it's got a single path for things to drive the keyboard, when it should've been using the sysfs framework for that or had code to trawl /dev looking in several places or throughout all of it, for the keyboard it needs to control...) and to provide an upstream/PPA for people and distributions to work with to have an "upstream" that's being at least marginally curated.
